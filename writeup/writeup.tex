\section{Introduction}

In a stochastic game like Limit Poker, how far can we exploit imperfect information to maximise our gains? 

Our poker agent is also placed under a time constraint for every action, so 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Functionality, the agent should be rational and be at least able to recognise statistically optimal hole cards which are worth investing in. However, chance alone does not make our agent a winner. In Poker, a core strategy is the ability to model and subsequently predict how an opponent is behaving. This enhancement allows our agent to gain an advantage over randomness, and rake the opponent's money.
	\item
	\item Why did you choose this implementation (i.e. why should the reader be interested?)
	\item What is the result that you achieved? (i.e. why should the reader believe you?)
\end{enumerate}
